Weather App






This Weather App allows users to search for weather information by city name, view suggestions while typing, and fetch data from an ESP32 sensor (DHT11). The app retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it alongside sensor data fetched from Firebase Realtime Database.
